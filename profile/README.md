# Welcome to the GitHub Demo and learning org

If you are reading this, you are a Microsoft employee that is interested about learning how GitHub products work and to show GitHub value to customers. 

Thank you for the interest and the joint work.


**GitHub was created for collaboration**. Learning from others and contributing to what others are doing is why GitHub was created, and the reason it become the platform for so many diverse developers around the world to create the tools that are now used by >90% of the Enterprise customers. (If you have doubts, let me drop a few names: Kubernetes, Node.js, Apacheâ€¦)

Here you can work with your colleagues over the demo materials and try by yourself the value we provide to our customers. So please invite others to join - just invite them [to register](https://aka.ms/RequestADemoGitHubOrganization)

*Remember this demo environment is for learning and to demo to customers only*: Microsoft rules doesnâ€™t allow to host any IP (neither yours, or owned by Microsoft or by a customer)

Many people are using these GitHub organizations to host, create, share and collaborate over demos for GitHub but also for many other Azure products (infra, apps and data), and we think thatâ€™s beautiful ðŸ˜Š

If you like the topic, I am sure you will want to sharpen your technical knowledge and see other experiences, so let me point to a few valuable resources to learn more:
- [DevOps Shots](http://aka.ms/DevOpsSHOTs): a weekly 30â€™ min session full of demos and tech learning. See previous sessions [here](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/DevOpsLearning/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fteams%2FDevOpsLearning%2FShared%20Documents%2FDevOps%20SHOTS%2FRecorded%20Sessions).
